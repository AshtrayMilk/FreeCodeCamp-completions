# FreeCodeCamp-completions

IM JUST DOING FREECODECAMP FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT AS GAMES AINT THAT ENDEARNING.
FUCKING IGNORE EVERYTHING YOU SEE HERE. 

ok probably nobody will see anything whats happening here. HAH BETTER THAT WAY!

For some reason when you try to download completions 
from freecodecamp it saves every file as .txt
Not sure why, what is going with it.
I could change the filetype, but I'm too lazy
to change that shit for nothing.
